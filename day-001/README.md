## FizzBuzz Problem (http://programming.dojo.net.nz/codex/fizz-buzz/index)

Fizz Buzz is a mathematical game which is played with a group of people. Each person says a number in sequence, but when the number is a multiple of 3, they have to say "Fizz", when it is a multiple of 5 they have to say "Buzz", and if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz". If someone makes a mistake and it is noticed, they are out.

A typical game might start like: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, etc
